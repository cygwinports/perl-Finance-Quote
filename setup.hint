ldesc: "This module gets time-delayed stock quotes from various internet
sources, including Yahoo! Finance, Fidelity Investments, and the
Australian Stock Exchange.  There are two methods of using this module
-- a functional interface that is depreciated, and an object-orientated
method that provides greater flexibility and stability."
